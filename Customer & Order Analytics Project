#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1)How many orders were placed in January?
select count(orderid)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(OrderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2)How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID' 
AND length(OrderID)= 6
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3)Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON customers.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID' 
AND length(OrderID)= 6;

#4)Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product,MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID' 
AND length(OrderID)= 6;

SELECT distinct Product,price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
order by price;

#5) What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
--Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products

SELECT distinct product, sum(quantity) as Quantity, price, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
Group by product
order by revenue;

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6) What is the total revenue sold in January?

SELECT sum(revenue)

FROM 
(SELECT distinct product, sum(quantity) as Quantity, price, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
Group by product);

#7) Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT *, quantity*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

select 
sum(Quantity), 
product, 
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#8) How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum) as Customers, avg(quantity)*price as Average_Spending
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT Join Bit_DB.customers cust 
ON Feb.orderiD= cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#9)List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT distinct product, sum(quantity) as Quantity_Sold, location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
